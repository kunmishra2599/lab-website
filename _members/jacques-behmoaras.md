### Education

### Brief
- I am Deputy Director of the Centre for Computational Biology, and lead the Immunogenomics Group at Duke-NUS Medical School (Program in Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disorders) in Singapore, where I have my primary academic appointment. I am also a Reader in Immunogenetics at Imperial College London. 
- We study gene, metabolite and lipid networks that controls macrophage function in complex inflammatory disorders. We use patient populations as well as animal models of chronic kidney disease and metabolic syndrome. We apply systems-genetics approaches to target macrophage immune and metabolic responses in these inflammatory conditions. Our recent approaches pointed towards the importance of macrophage senescence in ageing.
