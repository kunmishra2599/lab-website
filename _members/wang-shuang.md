### Brief
- I’m a dentist from China.
- From 2018 to 2021, I worked as a research fellow on Dental Pulp Regeneration in Dentistry of NUS. In 2023 I joined in the Centre for Computational Biology, Duke-NUS medical school in Singapore. I’m currently studying the mechanisms of iron metabolism in macrophages.
