### Brief
Xiaoting graduated with a bachelor's degree from Xiamen University in China. She then moved to Singapore to pursue a Ph.D. at Nanyang Technological University, under the supervision of Professor Christiane Ruedl. Her doctoral research focused on tissue-resident macrophages, particularly microglia and brain border-associated macrophages. After a short postdoctoral training in Ruedlâ€™s lab, Xiaoting then joined the lab of Jacques Behmoaras at the Centre for Computational Biology, Duke-NUS Medical School, where she continues to study macrophages in disease contexts.
